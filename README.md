A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Overview

Welcome to the College Chatbot project! This repository houses the code and resources for implementing a virtual assistant or chatbot for our college's webUI. The aim of this project is to enhance user experience by providing quick and efficient information to web visitors without the need for phone calls or emails.

## Problem Statement

Our college's webUI currently lacks a virtual assistant or chatbot system to assist web visitors. This results in visitors having to resort to calling the administration or writing emails to departments for information. This process is time-consuming for both the college and the visitors. Many leading companies and universities have adopted chatbots to streamline the process of providing information related to their services. This project addresses this gap by introducing a chatbot that will replace traditional helpdesk support, calls, and emails.

## Solution

The College Chatbot is a conversational agent based on AI and machine learning, specifically utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand user queries and provide relevant information in real-time. By integrating this chatbot into the college's webUI, we aim to create a more efficient and user-friendly platform for obtaining information.

## Features

- **Real-time Assistance:** Users can get instant responses to their queries without the need to wait for emails or phone calls.
- **24/7 Availability:** The chatbot is available round the clock, providing assistance to users at any time.
- **Information Retrieval:** The chatbot utilizes AI and machine learning to understand and respond to user queries, retrieving relevant information from the college's database.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The chatbox interface is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for users to interact and obtain the information they need.

## Technologies Used

- **AI and Machine Learning:** The core of the chatbot's functionality is powered by AI and ML algorithms.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP techniques are employed to understand and interpret user queries.
- **Python:** The project is implemented using Python programming language.
